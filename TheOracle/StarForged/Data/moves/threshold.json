Envision your final moments.\n  * There is more to be done. Envision what is revealed to you or asked of you at deathâ€™s door, and [Swear an Iron Vow](#Swear-an-Iron-Vow) to complete an extreme quest. You return to the mortal world and must mark **doomed**.

Envision your final moments.\n  * You see a vision of a dreaded event coming to pass. Envision that dark future, and [Swear an Iron Vow](#Swear-an-Iron-Vow) to prevent it through an extreme quest. You return to your senses and must mark **tormented**. When you complete the soul-bound quest, clear the impact.\n\nOn a **miss**, you succumb to despair or horror and are lost."

To learn the cost, roll the challenge dice and compare to the progress on your bonds legacy track.\n\nOn a **strong hit**, you may call in a favor. This comes without conditions.\n\nOn a **weak hit**, you owe someone. You must mark **indebted** and [Swear an Iron Vow](#Swear-an-Iron-Vow) to complete an extreme quest in their service. When you complete the duty-bound quest, clear the impact.\n\nOn a **miss**, as with the weak hit result, but this quest is against your nature, forces you to [Forsake Your Vow](#Forsake-Your-Vow) on another quest, or is in the service of an enemy.\n\nIf you accept the cost, take 1 experience for every marked ability on the discarded assets (minimum 3 experience). Spend this experience only on a new command vehicle, modules, and support vehicles."
